    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl with warm water, add sugar and salt and mix.
                Sprinkle the yeast and cover it for 5 to 10 minutes or until yeast is activated.
                Now add shortening and flour, and knead it until you get a smooth elastic dough.<br/> You may have to vary the amount of flour depending on the weather condition.
                Brush the bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough. Cover and let it sit for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until nearly doubled in size.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl add in marinara sauce and optional seasoning mentioned, mix well and keep it aside.
                In another bowl combine all the cheese and keep it aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degree F.
                Transfer the risen dough from step I to a well floured surface, punch the dough and roll it to desired shape and thickness. I have rolled it into 16 inch pizza. 
                <br/>Top the crust with the sauce followed by cheese blend.
                Bake it for 12 to 15 minutes. Slice the hot pizza.
                <br/>Five Cheese Pizza is now ready. Serve immediately and enjoy.</li>
